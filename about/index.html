My name is Wilhelm, a Lead IT Project Manager and Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience
in the IT industry.</p><p>Throughout my career, I have worked in various roles, including as a researcher, senior software engineer, IT project
manager, lead IT project manager, and head of division.</p><p>As a manager, I have successfully led projects ranging from 2 to 30 people and ensured that they run smoothly and
successfully. As head of division, I was responsible for personnel, sales, account management, and all other roles
that come with being head of division.</p><p>Software Engineering has been a strong passion of mine since my youth. Throughout my career, I have realized that the
further I moved away from it, the stronger the attraction became. Therefore, I have decided to fully immerse myself in

opinion, it was the right one for me.</p><p>Currently, I am back working as a senior software engineer and developing innovative applications.</p><p>In my free time, I used to have a strong interest in photography and private programming projects. However, since the
birth of my children, they have become my greatest hobby and leisure activity. I enjoy spending time with them and
observing their development.</p><p>I started this blog primarily for myself. I wanted to find a way to improve my writing and English skills. Just read
