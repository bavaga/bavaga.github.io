One small part of that feature was to display a progress indicator for a task. I decided to use something called Harvey Balls for this.
These are my own requirements for the solutions:
It should be simple. It should be written purely in CSS. It should be defined by CSS classes that can be applied to a single div or span element, turning it into a progress indicator.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://www.bavaga.com/blog/2022/12/31/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:36:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.bavaga.com/blog/2022/12/31/hello-world/</guid><description>So, here I am. I reached my goals for 2022 in the final hours:
Started a blog (✔️) Posted the first post (✔️) Accomplished my mission (✔️) No, no, no, I&amp;rsquo;m kidding. My mission is not accomplished yet. My mission has only just begun.
My personal growth I always thought about this step, but I never dared to start &amp;ldquo;My own blog&amp;rdquo;.
Here I am. My goals are pretty simple. They are focused mainly on my personal growth.</description></item></channel></rss>
